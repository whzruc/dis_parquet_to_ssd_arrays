# dis_parquet_to_ssd_arrays

## Function Explanation:
The main purpose of this Python code is to handle data transformation and distribution. 
It specifically focuses on files with the .tbl extension in the current working directory.
Firstly, it reads each .tbl file line by line. For every line, it removes the trailing | character and appends a newline character. Then, it groups the lines into blocks according to predefined partition sizes (stored in the split_size dictionary for different tables).

Once a block is filled, it creates a temporary .tbl file for that block and then uses the pyarrow library to convert that temporary file into a Parquet file. The Parquet files are then distributed across multiple directories specified by the prefix list. The prefix list contains paths where the Parquet files will be placed, typically spread across different SSDs or storage locations.

After processing all the blocks of a .tbl file, including any remaining lines at the end that didn't fill a full block, it constructs a SQL-like CREATE VIEW statement that references all the Parquet files belonging to that table in the distributed locations. Finally, it returns a list of these view statements for all the processed .tbl files, which can potentially be used for further data querying or manipulation in a database or data analysis context that supports Parquet file access through such views.

In summary, this code is mainly used for converting .tbl files into Parquet format and distributing the resulting Parquet files across multiple designated directories while generating corresponding view statements for easy access to the data later.
